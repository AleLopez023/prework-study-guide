        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>git status:</strong> checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li><strong>git checkout -b branch-name:</strong> creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li><strong>git clone:</strong> Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer. This will make a copy of the project to your local workspace so you can start working with it.</li>
          <li><strong>git branch:</strong> Creates a new branch locally <strong>(git branch "branch-name")</strong>.</li> 
          <li><strong>git push:</strong> Pushes the branch into the remote repo. <strong>(git push -u "remote" "branch-name")</strong></li>  
          <li><strong>git branch or git branch --list</strong>: Allows you to view branches.</li>  
          <li><strong>git branch -d "branch-name"</strong>: Allows you to delete a branch.</li>  
          <li><strong>git add</strong>: Adds a single file. You can also use <strong>git add -A</strong> to add everthing at once. <strong>The git add command doesn't change the repository and the changes are not saved until we use git commit.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>git commit</strong>: Is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed. Be sure to add a short message to explain what was developed or change with <strong>git commit -m "commit message".<br /> IMPORTANT: git commit saves your changes only locally.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>git push</strong>: Uploads your commits to the remote repository. The main way to do this is <strong>git push "remote" "branch-name"</strong>. If a new branch was created, then you have to upload the branch with the following command: <strong>git push --set-upstream "remote" "name-of-your-branch"</strong>or <strong>git push -u origin "branch_name".<br /> IMPORTANT: git push only uploads changes that are committed.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>git pull</strong>: Used to get updates from the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge). <strong>git pull "remote"</strong></li>
          <li><strong>git merge</strong>: When you're finished developing, allows you to merge the branch to the main branch. It's important to remember that you first need to be on the specific branch that you want to merge with your feature branch. An example would be as follows:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Switch to main branch: <strong>git checkout main</strong></li>
              <li>Before merging, update you local main branch: <strong>git fetch</strong></li>
              <li>Merge your feature branch into the main branch: <strong>git merge "branch-name"</strong></li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>No one uses "var", so don't use it either.</li>
            <li><strong>const:</strong> keyword that allows you to declare a variable. This variable cannot be reassigned.</li>
            <li><strong>let:</strong> keyword that allows you to reassign the value of a variable.</li>
            <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
            <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
            <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times</li>
            <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code: let x = 0;</li>
                <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x &lt; shapes.length;</li>
                <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code: x++</li>
                <li>Final code would look like: <br /> for(let x =0; x &lt; shapes.length; x++) { <br /> // code block ex. console.log(shapes[x]);<br /> }</li>
              </ol>
          </ul>
